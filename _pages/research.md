#### Situating Public Memory Within a Transnational Global Memoryscape: “Comfort Women,” Monuments, and White Sexual Imperialism
> *Presented at 20th Biennial Conference of the Rhetoric Society of America, 2022.*
>
> *Abstract*: This paper offers a rhetorical analysis of the San Francisco “Comfort Women” Column of Strength memorial, one of the few monuments in the United States depicting Asian women. I argue that the monument is a site of national forgetting that contributes to U.S. collective and historical amnesia regarding the violent rhetorical ecologies in which Asian women dwell in the U.S. Placing the monument within the theoretical framework of global memoryscapes and white sexual imperialism, I argue that a transnational global memoryscape framework allows one to better understand the imperialized, racialized, and gendered violence against Asian women as a transnational and relevant issue. Ultimately, I argue that a critical, transnational lens on public memory is imperative to situate national public memories within a global context as memories flow across borders via media, culture, and communication.

#### Tokyo Rose and Seoul City Sue: Citizenship, Belonging, Racial Rhetorical Ecologies
> *Recognized as a part of the Laureate Group for the James L. Golden Outstanding Student Essay in Rhetoric Award.*
>
> *Presented at National Communication Association 109th Annual Convention, 2023.*
>
> *Abstract*: Citizenship is a fluctuating category of identity and belonging that relies heavily on a nation’s imagined collective meanings of race and gender at a specific time, place, and context. Through primary and secondary materials such as archival materials and newspaper accounts, I build upon rhetorical scholarship centering
race and the function of rhetoric to create material realities to examine how two female 20th century war radio “propogandists,” Iva Toguri D’Aquino (widely
known as Tokyo Rose) and Ann Wallace Suh (widely known as Seoul City Sue), figured differently in the U.S. public’s rhetorical imagination and unique racial
rhetorical ecology. I frame citizenship as (1) prescribing belonging, (2) gendered and raced belonging, and (3) conditional belonging. Ultimately, I argue that
citizenship is a precarious and conditional mode of belonging that, despite its promises to provide and protect, always shifts in protection of whiteness and its
ever-evolving racial fears.
