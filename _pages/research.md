> *Research Questions*
> 
> - Overarching: What are the rhetorical conditions of citizenship and national belonging in contemporary South Korea amidst a low fertility rate crisis?
> - Case Study 1: How do queer and reproducing citizens negotiate their national belonging to the state? Or, how do citizens negotiate queerness and reproduction in seeking national belonging to the state?
> - Case Study 2: How do non-reproductive gendered citizens reframe national belonging beyond reproduction? Or, how do citizens demand a reproduction of livability from a state that demands the reproduction of life?
> - Case Study 3: How does the racialized migrant care worker illuminate the state‚Äôs ideals of the racially desirable reproductive citizen? Or, how does the rhetorical discourse surrounding migrant care workers in South Korea point to the racialized dimensions of the fertility rate crisis?

"Situating Public Memory Within a Transnational Global Memoryscape: ‚ÄúComfort Women,‚Äù Monuments, and White Sexual Imperialism."

- Presented at 20th Biennial Conference of the Rhetoric Society of America, 2022.

> Abstract: This paper offers a rhetorical analysis of the San Francisco ‚ÄúComfort Women‚Äù Column of Strength memorial, one of the few monuments in the United States depicting Asian women. I argue that the monument is a site of national forgetting that contributes to U.S. collective and historical amnesia regarding the violent rhetorical ecologies in which Asian women dwell in the U.S. Placing the monument within the theoretical framework of global memoryscapes and white sexual imperialism, I argue that a transnational global memoryscape framework allows one to better understand the imperialized, racialized, and gendered violence against Asian women as a transnational and relevant issue. Ultimately, I argue that a critical, transnational lens on public memory is imperative to situate national public memories within a global context as memories flow across borders via media, culture, and communication.

> *Abstract:* Citizenship is a fluctuating category of identity and belonging that relies heavily on a nation‚Äôs imagined collective meanings of race and gender at a specific time, place, and context. Through primary and secondary materials such as archival materials and newspaper accounts, I build upon rhetorical scholarship centering
race and the function of rhetoric to create material realities to examine how two female 20th century war radio ‚Äúpropogandists,‚Äù Iva Toguri D‚ÄôAquino (widely
known as Tokyo Rose) and Ann Wallace Suh (widely known as Seoul City Sue), figured differently in the U.S. public‚Äôs rhetorical imagination and unique racial
rhetorical ecology. I frame citizenship as (1) prescribing belonging, (2) gendered and raced belonging, and (3) conditional belonging. Ultimately, I argue that
citizenship is a precarious and conditional mode of belonging that, despite its promises to provide and protect, always shifts in protection of whiteness and its
ever-evolving racial fears.

> "What are the ways in which national memory and consumption intersect to create different ways of belonging? In this piece, I examine the site of Ikseon-dong Hanok Village and its invitation to consume artifacts that draw upon a shared national history, an invitation to partake via consumption. I identify places such as these as cosmopolitan and glocalized, engaging in a transnational and economic citizenship. Building upon Sharon Shui-yin Yam‚Äôs term of a cosmopolitan consumer subject, referring to economic par- ticipants in transnational brands (Yam 2017), I shift my attention to the spaces that such subjects occupy, these glocalized cosmopolitan spaces of belonging..."

> "With her YouTube cooking videos, Harris cooks herself out of containn1ent in a reformative, although not revolutionary, way. Still operating within the bounds of the "exotic" and the feminine, Harris takes the topic of her heritage to rein vent her Otherness into a curious yet safe experience of culinary tourism and culinary citizenship for her largely nonimmigrant audience. Her differences are just interesting, curious, and fresh enough to be enjoyable, not threatening..."
